# Wrapper for starting the Django development server on varying
# addresses and port numbers. Allowing to also run if manage.py is in
# the (parent directory of a) parent directory of $PWD. It automatically
# uses runserver_plus with the Werkzeug debugger when django_extensions
# is installed.
#
# Usage: runserver [port (default=8000)] [address (default=127.0.0.1)]
