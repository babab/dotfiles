# envtest: Check paths and versions of python, pip and virtual environment
#
# DESCRIPTION
# There are numerous ways in which the python interpreter and
# its version and helper scripts are used. Combined with virtual
# environments the possibilities are endless. This script helps identify
# the following real world issues that I've come across over the years:
#
# - The `python` executable that is found first in PATH is not the
#   version you expected it to be.
# - The `pip` executable that is found first in PATH is not pointing to the
#   `python` you expected it to be.
# - The `pip` executable differs from `python -m pip` (e.g. on Cygwin).
# - You expect `python` or `pip` to be pointing to your virtual
#   environment and it isn't.
#
# The output of this script is formatted in reStructuredText which
# is the de facto documentation markup language used in Python. You
# can therefore convert the report it makes to info, man, pdf etc.
# Creating HTML is as easy as piping to rst2html:
#
#    envtest | rst2html > # report.html
